# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game. In this game, the player controls a snake that moves around the game area. The objective of the game is to eat the food that appears at random positions in the game area. Each time the snake eats the food, it grows longer and the player's score increases. The game ends when the snake hits the game area boundary or its own body.

The game is implemented using JavaScript and HTML5 canvas for rendering. The game features include a scoring system and a game over condition.
